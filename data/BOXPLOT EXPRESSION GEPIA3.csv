KLK10,6.85,4.39,⬆️ Upregulated,3.1×10⁻²⁷,Strongly overexpressed in tumors — KLK10 is known as a cancer-associated kallikrein involved in tumor invasion and metastasis.,,
ERLIN1,3.68,3.87,⬇️ Slightly downregulated,2.1×10⁻³,Mild but significant decrease in tumor tissue; may affect ER stress or lipid metabolism.,,
LETMD1,5.24,6.29,⬇️ Downregulated,2.9×10⁻³²,Highly significant decrease; linked to mitochondrial and metabolic regulation.,,
DNAAF6,0.04,0,⬆️ Upregulated,4.5×10⁻⁵,"Low overall expression, but significantly higher in tumors — may indicate ciliogenesis disruption.",,
ZSWIM7,3.86,5.18,⬇️ Downregulated,2.47×10⁻⁵⁵,Strongly reduced in tumors; could relate to DNA repair or cell cycle functions.,,
